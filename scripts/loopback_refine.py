# MVP:
# 1. script should embed into text2video extension interface
# 2. add a drop down specifying the "refinement" model (i.e. the upscaler)
# 3. box for specifying the number of loopbacks (in future, maybe this could be inferred from strength curve?)

# FUTURE:
# 4. add a box for specifying prompts for refinement runs. todo: prompt-to-prompt syntax support
# 5. add a box for specifying parameter curves. MVP: diffusion strengths

# ... oh hmm.. looks like a1111 scripts are only supported for two builtin tabs
